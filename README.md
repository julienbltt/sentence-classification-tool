# Question Classification Tool

This tool provides real-time classification of natural language questions for seamless integration into the [**Commpanion Blind**](https://github.com/julienbltt/commpanion-blind) project. It uses [Sentence-BERT](https://www.sbert.net/) to semantically match user input to pre-defined intent categories.

---

## Features

- Classifies questions into intent categories using SBERT (`all-distilroberta-v1`)
- Fast and lightweight for real-time interaction
- Easily extendable with additional categories
- Built-in CLI for quick testing

---

## Intents & Templates

Currently supports classification into the following categories:

### `read_text`
Example prompts:
- "tell me what does it say"
- "read the text"
- "can you read this"
- "what's written here"
- "what is written on this menu"
- "Read the instructions for me"
- "tell me the words on the sign"

### `describe_scene`
Example prompts:
- "what do you see"
- "can you explain me what's around me"
- "describe me the scene"
- "what's happening here"
- "can you tell me what is in front of me"
- "describe the surroundings"

### `activate_detection_collision`
Example prompts:
- "Turn on the collision detector."
- "Activate collision detection."
- "Can you enable obstacle detection?"
- "Start the collision avoidance system."
- "Please switch on collision detection."
- "Enable the object detection feature."

## Getting Started

> **Note:** This tool was developed and tested on **Python 3.10**. Compatibility with other Python versions has not been tested.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers torch
```

### 2. Run the demo

```bash
python test.py
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter a message. The system will return the predicted intent and a confidence score.

## Usage Example

The function take in input the intent (str) and will return the predicted intent category (str) and the confidence (float).

```python
from sbertClassification import classify

text = "can you read this for me?"
intent, confidence = classify(text)
print(f"Predicted Intent: {intent} (confidence={confidence:.2f})")
```
Output:
```yaml
Predicted Intent: read_text (confidence=0.53)
```

## How does it work

1) Input text is embedded using SBERT (`all-distilroberta-v1`).
2) Each intent category has a pre-computed mean embedding from its example templates.
3)  The tool computes cosine similarity between the input and each intent category.
4) The most similar intent is returned along with a confidence score.

## Performance Metrics

Evaluated on a dataset of 100 samples per category (300 total):
| Model                | Accuracy | Avg Time (ms) |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| all-distilroberta-v1 | 99.67%   | 19.47         |

The classifier demonstrates high accuracy and low inference latency, making it suitable for real-time systems
