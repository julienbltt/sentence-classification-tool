# Intent Classification Tool

This tool provides real-time classification of natural language questions for seamless integration into the [**Commpanion Blind**](https://github.com/julienbltt/commpanion-blind) project. It uses [Sentence-BERT](https://www.sbert.net/) to semantically match user input to pre-defined intent categories with advanced margin-based confidence scoring.

## Features

- **Semantic Classification**: Uses SBERT (`all-MiniLM-L12-v2`) for robust intent recognition
- **Margin-Based Confidence**: Intelligent fallback to 'other' when top predictions are too close
- **Dynamic Category Management**: Add, remove, and modify intent categories at runtime
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed classification reports with all similarity scores
- **Fast & Lightweight**: Optimized for real-time interaction
- **Extensible Architecture**: Object-oriented design for easy integration

## Intent Categories & Templates

The classifier supports the following pre-defined categories:

### `read_text`
Requests to read visible text content:
- "Can you read aloud what's written here?"
- "Please read the text shown on the screen."
- "What does the writing say on that sign?"
- "Tell me exactly what the label says."
- "Could you read the message displayed in front of me?"
- "What are the words written on this surface?"

### `describe_scene`
Requests for environmental descriptions:
- "Can you describe what's happening around me?"
- "What do you see in this area?"
- "Give me a detailed description of the scene."
- "Describe the setting and objects nearby."
- "Tell me what the surroundings look like?"
- "What's visible in the current environment?"

### `activate_detection_collision`
Requests to enable safety features:
- "Please enable obstacle and hazard detection."
- "Turn on the collision prevention system now."
- "Start the object and movement detection feature."
- "Activate sensors to detect anything I might bump into."
- "Can you switch on the obstacle warning system?"
- "Enable collision alerts and monitoring, please."

### `other`
General requests outside the main categories:
- "Play some background music."
- "What's the weather forecast for today?"
- "Remind me about my 5 PM meeting."
- "Call my mother's phone."
- "Open the phone's camera app."
- "Show directions to the nearest grocery store."

## Getting Started

> **Note:** This tool was developed and tested on **Python 3.10**. Compatibility with other Python versions has not been tested.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers torch
```

### 2. Basic Usage

```python
from intent_classifier import IntentClassifier

# Initialize the classifier
classifier = IntentClassifier()

# Classify a single input
text = "Can you read this for me?"
intent, confidence = classifier.classify(text)
print(f"Predicted Intent: {intent} (confidence={confidence:.2f})")

# Get detailed analysis
details = classifier.get_classification_details(text)
print(f"All scores: {details['all_scores']}")
```

### 3. Advanced Usage

```python
# Initialize with custom parameters
classifier = IntentClassifier(
    model_name='all-MiniLM-L12-v2',
    margin_threshold=0.15
)

# Add a new intent category
new_examples = [
    "Set a timer for 10 minutes",
    "Start the countdown timer",
    "Create an alarm for tomorrow"
]
classifier.add_intent_category("set_timer", new_examples)

# Modify margin threshold
classifier.set_margin_threshold(0.2)

# Get all available categories
categories = classifier.get_intent_categories()
print(f"Available categories: {categories}")

# Clean up resources when done
classifier.cleanup()
```

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Pre-computes mean embeddings for each intent category using example templates
2. **Input Processing**: User input is encoded using SBERT (`all-MiniLM-L12-v2`)
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Computes cosine similarity between input and each category embedding
4. **Margin-Based Decision**: Returns the top intent only if it significantly outperforms the second-best option
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence scores based on similarity margins and absolute thresholds

### Margin Threshold Logic

The classifier uses a margin threshold (default: 0.1) to ensure confident predictions:
- If the difference between the top two predictions is ≤ threshold, returns `'other'`
- If the top prediction score is < 0.2, returns `'other'`
- This prevents misclassification when the input is ambiguous or outside known categories

## API Reference

### Core Methods

- `classify(text)` → `(intent: str, confidence: float)`
- `get_classification_details(text)` → `dict` with full analysis
- `add_intent_category(name, examples)` → Add new category
- `remove_intent_category(name)` → Remove existing category
- `set_margin_threshold(threshold)` → Adjust confidence threshold
- `get_intent_categories()` → List all categories
- `get_category_examples(name)` → Get examples for a category

### Configuration Options

- `model_name`: SBERT model to use (default: `'all-MiniLM-L12-v2'`)
- `margin_threshold`: Minimum confidence margin (default: `0.1`)

## Performance Metrics

Evaluated on a dataset of 100 samples per category (400 total samples):

| Model | Accuracy | Avg Time (ms) | Margin Threshold |
|-------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| all-MiniLM-L12-v2 | 96.8% | 42.3 | 0.1 |

The classifier demonstrates high accuracy with intelligent ambiguity handling, making it ideal for real-time assistive technology applications.
